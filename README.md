# Netflix Login Clone

Cloning Netflix's login page using **TailwindCSS** and **no javascript**.

I've learned Tailwind this weekend 11/11 -> 11/13 and decided to practice it a little bit by cloning Netflix's login page.

The whole process was pretty straightfoward, read the documentation, wrote notes, installed packages and started applying.

_[Notes can be found here](https://gabriel-araujo.notion.site/Tailwind-CSS-963977a7dc454706bf44789d4ac0d56f)_

> Installation process is explained there.

### Features

- Fully responsive.
- Input validation with warnings.
- Very similar UI and forms.
- Zero Javascript (The only .js file in this repo is tailwind.config.js).
